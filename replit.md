# Warehouse Management System (WMS)

## Project Overview
A comprehensive warehouse management system with SAP B1 integration, built with Flask and PostgreSQL. This system handles goods receipt, inventory transfers, pick lists, inventory counting, bin scanning, QR code label printing, and quality control operations.

## Architecture
- **Backend**: Flask with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (migrated from MySQL/SQLite for Replit compatibility)
- **Authentication**: Flask-Login with role-based permissions
- **External Integration**: SAP Business One via REST API
- **Frontend**: Jinja2 templates with Bootstrap UI
- **Deployment**: Gunicorn WSGI server on Replit

## Key Features
1. **User Management**: Role-based access control (admin, manager, user, qc)
2. **GRPO (Goods Receipt PO)**: Purchase order receipt processing
3. **Inventory Transfer**: Item movement between locations
4. **Pick List Management**: Order fulfillment operations
5. **Inventory Counting**: Stock count reconciliation
6. **Bin Scanning**: Barcode scanning for warehouse locations
7. **QR Code Labels**: Label generation and printing
8. **Quality Control Dashboard**: QC workflow management
9. **SAP B1 Integration**: Real-time data synchronization

## Database Schema
- **Users**: Authentication and role management
- **Branches**: Multi-location support
- **GRPO Documents**: Purchase receipt records
- **Inventory Transfers**: Stock movement tracking
- **Pick Lists**: Order picking workflows
- **Inventory Counts**: Stock counting operations
- **Bin Scanning Logs**: Location scanning history
- **QR Code Labels**: Label generation tracking

## Security Features
- Password hashing with Werkzeug
- Session-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- SQL injection protection via SQLAlchemy
- CSRF protection ready

## Replit Migration Status
- [x] PostgreSQL database provisioned
- [x] Database configuration updated for Replit
- [x] Gunicorn workflow configured
- [x] Environment variables structured
- [x] Application testing and validation
- [x] QR code library enhanced with qrcode[pil]
- [x] Dual database support maintained (MySQL priority, PostgreSQL fallback)

## User Preferences
- **Database Priority**: MySQL for local development, PostgreSQL for cloud deployment
- **Development Environment**: Dual database support to maintain local machine MySQL sync
- **Integration Focus**: SAP B1 integration with batch management and warehouse operations
